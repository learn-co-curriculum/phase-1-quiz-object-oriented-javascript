# OOJS: Classes

How would I make a new instance of the following class?

```javascript
class Dog {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}
```

## Correct

```javascript
let spinach = new Dog("Spinach", 4);
```

> Nailed it! Using the `new` keyword will call the `constructor` function and
> return a new `Dog` object.

## Incorrect

```javascript
let spinach = Dog.new("Spinach", 4);
```

> Not quite. We must use the `new` keyword, rather than calling `.new` as a
> method.

## Incorrect

```javascript
let spinach = Dog.constructor("Spinach", 4);
```

> Not quite. We must use the `new` keyword, rather than calling `.constructor`
> as a method.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
