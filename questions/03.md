# OOJS: Classes

Why would I put the `get` keyword in front of the `area` method in the following
class? (select all that apply)

```javascript
class Square {
  constructor(sideLength) {
    this.sideLength = sideLength;
  }

  get area() {
    return this.sideLength * this.sideLength;
  }
}
```

## Correct

The method to compute the area doesn't run until it's needed, saving a
potentially computationally expensive operation from being performed.

## Correct

It allows us to treat `area` like a property rather than a method.

## Correct

If the `sideLength` ever changes, the `area` will be re-calculated.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
