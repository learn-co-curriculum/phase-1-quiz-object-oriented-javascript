# OOJS: Classes

Why would I put the get keyword in front of the area method in the following class? (select all that apply)

```
class Square {
  constructor(sideLength) {
    this.sideLength = sideLength;
  }

  get area() {
    return this.sideLength * this.sideLength;
  }
}
```

&nbsp;

## Correct

The area calculation isn't run until it's accessed.

## Correct

If it was included in the constructor, the process would be ran everytime I made
a new instance of Square.

## Correct

If the data from the properties ever change, the get method is able to use the
updated value.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
