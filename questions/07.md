# OOJS Instance Methods

How would I call the `sayHello` method on `spinach`?

```javascript
class Dog {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Woof, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}
let spinach = new Dog("Spinach", 4);
```

## Correct

```javascript
spinach.sayHello();
```

## Incorrect

```javascript
Dog.sayHello(spinach);
```

## Incorrect

```javascript
sayHello(spinach);
```

## Incorrect

I don't know.
