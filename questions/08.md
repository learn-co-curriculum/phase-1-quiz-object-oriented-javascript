# OOJS: Instance Methods

How would I find the area of the `square` variable?

```javascript
class Square {
  constructor(sideLength) {
    this.sideLength = sideLength;
  }

  get area() {
    return this.sideLength * this.sideLength;
  }
}

let square = new Square(5);
```

## Correct

```javascript
square.area;
```

## Incorrect

```javascript
square.area();
```

I don't know.
