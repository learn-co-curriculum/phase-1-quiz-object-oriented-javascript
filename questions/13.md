# OOJS: Static Methods

Given the following class definitions:

```javascript
class Pet {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  static definition() {
    return `A pet is an animal kept primarily for a person's company.`;
  }
}

// Inherits from Pet

class Dog extends Pet {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name);
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  static definition() {
    return (
      super.definition() + " Dogs are one of the most common types of pets."
    );
  }
}
let spinach = new Dog("Spinach", "Shina Inu");
```
